~~When I click generate schedule do something to show that the schedule is generating, it hangs for a few seconds now before showing that it is generating the schedule. Also disable the button until the schedule is generated.~~
~~The Print Options configuration should be stored every time it changes and use the LAST selected options. ~~
~~When I click on the text for Show Player Rankings or Color Mode it changes the Compact Layout checkbox so the checkboxes aren't properly associated with their labels.~~
On the Print Configuration Screen the placeholder text and the regular text is indistinguishable in dark mode - make the dark mode version visible but clearly lighter so that it is clear what is filled in and what isn't.
The Generating PDF toast alert should be closed as soon as the PDF is actually generated, do not wait for the normal timeout.
The normal timeout for removing toast alerts is too long - shorten it by 50%.
The dark mode preview has a white for the header boxes like "Round", "Court 1", "Resting" (they should be black) and the Event Name h1 is too light and should be black.
